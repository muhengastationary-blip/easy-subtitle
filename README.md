# easy-subtitle

A fast, single-binary CLI tool for automated subtitle extraction, downloading, and synchronization. Written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), ported from the Python project [Subservient](https://github.com/N3xigen/Subservient).

## Why a Crystal port?

Subservient is a capable ~10,000-line Python tool with an interactive menu UI, ffsubsync dependency, and INI config. **easy-subtitle** modernizes it into:

- **Single static binary** — no Python runtime, no pip, no virtualenv
- **Subcommand CLI** — scriptable, composable, no interactive menus
- **Pluggable sync backend** — `alass` by default, optional `ffsubsync` backend support
- **YAML config** — simpler than INI, with sensible defaults
- **Parallel sync** — Crystal fibers for concurrent subtitle synchronization
- **Low runtime dependencies** — just the binary + `mkvtoolnix` and your configured sync backend on your PATH

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install akitaonrails/tap/easy-subtitle
```

### Quick install (Linux x86_64)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akitaonrails/easy-subtitle/master/install.sh | bash
```

Linux release binaries are built as static musl binaries so they can run on both Ubuntu and Arch without extra runtime libraries.

### From GitHub Releases

Download the latest binary for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/akitaonrails/easy-subtitle/releases), then:

```bash
chmod +x easy-subtitle
sudo mv easy-subtitle /usr/local/bin/
```

### Build from source

Requires [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) >= 1.15.0:

On Linux, install the native development packages first.

Ubuntu / Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev libyaml-dev libssl-dev libpcre2-dev
```

Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed zlib libyaml openssl pcre2
```

That is enough for a normal Linux build on Arch.

If you want a fully static Linux binary from source, build it in a musl environment instead of trying to statically link against your host glibc stack. The release workflow does this with the official Alpine-based Crystal image.

Example:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --volume "$PWD:/work" \
  --workdir /work \
  crystallang/crystal:latest-alpine \
  sh -lc 'shards install --production && crystal build src/easy_subtitle.cr -o easy-subtitle --release --no-debug --static'
```

That static musl binary is the one intended to be portable across Ubuntu and Arch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akitaonrails/easy-subtitle.git
cd easy-subtitle
shards install
make release
sudo make install
```

## Prerequisites

These external tools must be on your PATH:

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
|---|---|---|
| [mkvtoolnix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/) | MKV track extraction/remuxing | `pacman -S mkvtoolnix-cli` / `brew install mkvtoolnix` / `apt install mkvtoolnix` |
| [alass](https://github.com/kaegi/alass) | Default subtitle synchronization backend | `cargo install alass-cli` or download from releases |
| [ffsubsync](https://github.com/smacke/ffsubsync) | Optional subtitle synchronization backend | `pipx install ffsubsync` or `pip install ffsubsync` |

An [OpenSubtitles](https://www.opensubtitles.com/) account and API key are required for the `download` command.

### OpenSubtitles Quotas

OpenSubtitles enforces account and API download limits. When you hit that limit, the `download` phase will fail with HTTP `406` and a message like:

```text
You have downloaded your allowed 20 subtitles for 24h.
```

That limit is not controlled by `easy-subtitle`. It depends on your OpenSubtitles account tier and API plan.

- Free accounts can have a small daily subtitle quota.
- Higher tiers such as VIP and paid API plans raise that quota.
- `easy-subtitle` now stops further candidate downloads for that language as soon as OpenSubtitles reports a quota/account restriction, instead of wasting more requests.

To make your quota last longer:

- Keep `top_downloads` low. `2` or `3` is usually enough.
- Keep `max_search_results` reasonable instead of pulling large candidate lists.
- Leave `resync_mode` off unless you really want to replace existing final subtitles.
- Remember that `smart_sync` tests more downloaded candidates, which improves selection quality but consumes more quota.

## Usage

```
easy-subtitle [OPTIONS] COMMAND [COMMAND_OPTIONS] PATH

Global Options:
  -c, --config PATH    Config file (default: ~/.config/easy-subtitle/config.yml)
  -v, --verbose        Verbose output
  -q, --quiet          Suppress non-error output
  --no-color           Disable colors
  --version            Show version
  -h, --help           Show help
```

### Commands

#### `init` — Generate default config

```bash
easy-subtitle init
easy-subtitle init -o ./my-config.yml
```

Creates a YAML config file with all defaults. Edit it to add your OpenSubtitles credentials.

#### `extract` — Extract subtitles from MKV

```bash
easy-subtitle extract /path/to/movies
easy-subtitle extract --remux /path/to/movies   # also strip unwanted tracks
```

Extracts embedded subtitle tracks (SRT, ASS) from MKV files using `mkvextract`.

#### `download` — Download subtitles from OpenSubtitles

```bash
easy-subtitle download /path/to/movies
easy-subtitle download -l en,pt /path/to/movies
```

Searches OpenSubtitles using movie hash (most accurate) and text search (fallback), then downloads the top candidates.

If OpenSubtitles returns HTTP `406`, the most common cause is an exhausted daily quota or account restriction. The command now shows the API message so you can tell the difference between a quota problem and a bad candidate.

#### `sync` — Synchronize subtitles with video

```bash
easy-subtitle sync /path/to/movies
```

Uses the configured sync backend to synchronize downloaded subtitle files with the video. Supports two strategies:

- **Smart sync** (default): runs all candidates in parallel, keeps the most-downloaded subtitle that the backend synchronizes successfully
- **First match**: stops at the first subtitle that the backend synchronizes successfully

Successful syncs are classified as either:

- **Accepted**: the backend completed without warning signals
- **Drift**: the backend completed but emitted warnings that suggest the subtitle should be reviewed

When a final `video.lang.srt` already exists, `download`, `sync`, and `run` skip that language unless `resync_mode` is enabled.

#### `run` — Full pipeline

```bash
easy-subtitle run /path/to/movies
easy-subtitle run --skip-extract /path/to/movies
```

Runs the complete pipeline: **extract → download → sync**. Individual phases can be skipped.

#### `clean` — Remove ads/watermarks

```bash
easy-subtitle clean /path/to/subtitles
easy-subtitle clean --no-backup /path/to/file.srt
```

Removes advertising blocks from SRT files (OpenSubtitles watermarks, "subtitles by" credits, URLs, social media handles, etc.). Creates `.bak` backups by default.

#### `scan` — Report subtitle coverage

```bash
easy-subtitle scan /path/to/movies
easy-subtitle scan --json /path/to/movies
easy-subtitle scan -l en,pt,ja /path/to/movies
```

Reports which videos have subtitles for your configured languages. Supports table and JSON output.

#### `hash` — Compute movie hash

```bash
easy-subtitle hash /path/to/movie.mkv
easy-subtitle hash -v /path/to/movie.mkv   # verbose with file size
```

Computes the OpenSubtitles 64-bit movie hash. Useful for debugging search results.

#### `doctor` — Check setup

```bash
easy-subtitle doctor
```

Validates your setup: checks config file, API credentials, tests API login, and verifies external tool dependencies (`mkvmerge`, `mkvextract`, and the configured sync backend) are installed. Shows platform-specific install instructions for any missing tools.

## Configuration

Generate the default config with `easy-subtitle init`, then edit `~/.config/easy-subtitle/config.yml`:

```yaml
# OpenSubtitles API credentials
api_key: ""
username: ""
password: ""
api_url: "https://api.opensubtitles.com/api/v1"

# Languages to download (ISO 639-1 codes)
languages:
  - en

# Audio track languages to keep when remuxing
audio_track_languages:
  - en
  - ja

# Legacy sync thresholds from Subservient (kept for config compatibility)
# The current sync flow no longer rejects successful backend runs on this basis.
accept_offset_threshold: 0.101
reject_offset_threshold: 2.5

# Behavior
series_mode: false                # true = treat folder as TV series
smart_sync: true                  # true = parallel all candidates, pick best
sync_backend: "alass"             # "alass" or "ffsubsync"
use_movie_hash: true              # true = hash search first (most accurate)
last_resort_search: false         # true = unfiltered search when all else fails

# Track handling
preserve_forced_subtitles: false
preserve_unwanted_subtitles: false
resync_mode: false                # true = re-sync even if subtitles exist

# Download limits
max_search_results: 10
top_downloads: 3                 # keep low if you want to conserve OpenSubtitles quota
download_retry_503: 6
```

## Architecture

```
easy-subtitle/
  src/easy_subtitle/
    cli/           # Subcommand router and command implementations
    core/          # Language maps, SRT parser/writer/cleaner, video scanner
    acquisition/   # OpenSubtitles API client, auth, search, download, movie hash
    extraction/    # MKV track parsing, extraction, remuxing
    synchronization/  # sync backends, offset calculator, smart/first-match strategies
    models/        # VideoFile, SubtitleCandidate, CoverageEntry
```

Key design choices:

- **Crystal fibers** for parallel smart-sync (spawn N backend processes, collect via Channel)
- **Rate-limited API client** (500ms throttle via Mutex, required by OpenSubtitles)
- **YAML::Serializable** config with validation and sensible defaults
- **Zero external shards** for production (only `webmock` for tests)
